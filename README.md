ðŸ“¸ðŸ“· Character Recognition (CR) is an AI tool for performing optic character recognition task. Given an image from a camera or an imported image the application must be able to recognize the text that are in the image in real time.

### API

CR api is a simple rest api that is served at `http://localhost:3001` and is able to detect text data from an image.

### Mobile

This is a mobile application that is consuming a rest api. The users are able to use this app to detect text from images that are in their gallery as well as images from their cameras.

<p align="center">
<img src="1.jpeg" alt="cover" width="200"/>
<img src="0.jpeg" alt="cover" width="200"/>
<img src="3.jpeg" alt="cover" width="200"/>
<img src="2.jpeg" alt="cover" width="200"/>
<p>

### API response

If a proper `POST` request is sent to the server at `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/recognize` we will be able to get all the text that were going to appear on the image.

### cURL request

If a `cURL` request is send to the server at localhost which looks as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST -F image=@text.png http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/recognize
```

The server will respond with the `API` response which looks as follows:

```json
{
  "results": [
    "You might like",
    "See more",
    "nanou",
    "@NanouuSymeon",
    "2d",
    "Which Programming Language is good for",
    "beginners?",
    "874",
    "2",
    "161",
    "1,395"
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

> Note that the text that are detected on the images are listed as `results`.

### Server

The server is actually slow in making these detections because it is running on a `CPU`.

### Why CR?

Character recognition was developed because I realized that most of the time when I buy airtime they give me a slip which contains the recharge `PIN` which is very long to type. Using this `tool` users can just take a picture of the `PIN` number and then `CR` recognize all the numbers for you accurately and all you need to do is `copy` and paste.

In this simple tool i'm using `MIT` license which read as follows:
